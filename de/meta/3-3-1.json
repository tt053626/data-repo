The environmental justice monitoring evaluates existing data of different core indicators (e.g. noise pollution and air pollution) and aggregates these data on a neighborhood level, respectively on a total of 447 so called planning areas (PLR), whereas Treptow-K\u00f6penick is divided into 34 planning areas. <br>                   \n\nThe data basis for the air pollution of the planning areas (PLR) are the area-weighted annual mean values 2009 of the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Subsequently, the determined values were divided into three categories (low: 79 PLRs, medium: 259 PLRs, high: 109 PLRs). <br> \n\nThe districts are affected to varying degrees by relative air pollution. In Treptow-K\u00f6penick, 1 PLR is highly polluted, 21 PLRs are medium polluted and 12 PLRs are low polluted. <br> \n\nOverall, air pollution in Berlin increases from the periphery to the center. For PM2.5, the values in the least polluted PLR were 14.8 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 and in the most polluted PLR 18.4 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the benchmark value of 10 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was exceeded in all PLRs in Berlin. For NO2, the values ranged from 11.3 to 27.3 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the WHO guideline value of 40 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was not exceeded.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-02-21","national_data_updated_date":"2021-07-16","target_number":"3.3","goal_number":"3"}

Since 2016, the annual learning conferences have taken place as live events in Treptow-K\u00f6penick, initially at the FEZ (Astrid Lindgren Stage) and subsequently digitally due to the pandemic. The participating schools from Germany are live on site, the international schools are either digitally connected or have submitted contributions in advance. Each learning conference has a specific theme that the schools have dealt with in advance and for which they have prepared a contribution at the learning conference.

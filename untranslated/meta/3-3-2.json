The data shown here includes the measurements for fine particulate matter (PM10) (daily values) and ozone (hourly values and 8-hourly values on a sliding scale). <br>\n\nFine particulate matter (PM10) refers to those particles in the air that are smaller than 10 \u00b5m. Depending on the size of the particles and the depth of penetration into the human body, the health effects vary. These can be, for example, irritation of the mucous membranes and inflammation of the bronchial tubes, increased plaque formation in the blood vessels or increased tendency to thrombosis. <br>\n\nOzone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms which can lead to irritation of the respiratory tract and the eyes as well as to the promotion of respiratory diseases.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-02-08","national_data_updated_date":"2022-01-20","target_number":"3.3","goal_number":"3"}

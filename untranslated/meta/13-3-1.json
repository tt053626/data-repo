The per capita emissions for each year were multiplied by Treptow-K\u00f6penick's population.\nThe data can thus only show an approximate picture, as they are not based on actual energy consumption in Treptow-K\u00f6penick. In addition, the polluter balance does not cover all areas. Emissions from energy conversion, for example, are not included.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-13","national_data_updated_date":"2021-10-13","target_number":"13.3","goal_number":"13"}

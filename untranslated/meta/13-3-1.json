The per capita emissions for each year were multiplied by Treptow-K\u00f6penick's population.\nThe data can thus only show an approximate picture, as they are not based on actual energy consumption in Treptow-K\u00f6penick. In addition, the polluter balance does not cover all areas. Emissions from energy conversion, for example, are not included.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-13","national_data_updated_date":"2021-10-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/tt053626/data-repo/commit/4b26ee86120f2cd73a01e0e5788baabbb7e8f5fe","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-10-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/tt053626/data-repo/commit/0aa459794cd0c35301cfcc67580f0fb240b9e5b1","indicator":"13.3.1"}

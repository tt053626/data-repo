Since the areas have different densities, the traffic noise exposure per capita was determined and monetized at external noise costs per person. The noise costs financially represent the loss of benefit that residents experience. The cost rates for this were provided by the Methodology Convention 2.0 of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). <br> \n\nAccording to these noise costs per capita, the 447 PLRs were sorted in ascending order and divided into three categories: The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact (86 PLRs), the top 20 percent high impact (also 86 PLRs), and all others medium impact (261 PLRs). No data exist for 14 PLRs. <br> \n\nThe districts are affected to varying degrees by noise. In Treptow-K\u00f6penick 4 PLRs are highly, 22 PLRs medium and 6 PLRs low burdened by noise. For 2 PLRs no data exist. <br> \n\nOverall, the external costs due to traffic noise differ greatly between the planning areas. In low polluted planning areas they amount up to 21 Euro per capita and year, in the high polluted category they range from 40 to 103 Euro. Berlin-wide, they are just under 45 euros.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-02-21","national_data_updated_date":"2021-07-16","target_number":"3.2","goal_number":"3"}

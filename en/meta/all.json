Since the areas have different densities, the traffic noise exposure per capita was determined and monetized at external noise costs per person. The noise costs financially represent the loss of benefit that residents experience. The cost rates for this were provided by the Methodology Convention 2.0 of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). <br> \n\nAccording to these noise costs per capita, the 447 PLRs were sorted in ascending order and divided into three categories: The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact (86 PLRs), the top 20 percent high impact (also 86 PLRs), and all others medium impact (261 PLRs). No data exist for 14 PLRs. <br> \n\nThe districts are affected to varying degrees by noise. In Treptow-K\u00f6penick 4 PLRs are highly, 22 PLRs medium and 6 PLRs low burdened by noise. For 2 PLRs no data exist. <br> \n\nOverall, the external costs due to traffic noise differ greatly between the planning areas.

The environmental justice monitoring evaluates existing data of different core indicators (e.g. noise pollution and air pollution) and aggregates these data on a neighborhood level, respectively on a total of 447 so called planning areas (PLR), whereas Treptow-K\u00f6penick is divided into 34 planning areas. <br>                   \n\nThe data basis for the air pollution of the planning areas (PLR) are the area-weighted annual mean values 2009 of the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Subsequently, the determined values were divided into three categories (low: 79 PLRs, medium: 259 PLRs, high: 109 PLRs). <br> \n\nThe districts are affected to varying degrees by relative air pollution. In Treptow-K\u00f6penick, 1 PLR is highly polluted, 21 PLRs are medium polluted and 12 PLRs are low polluted. <br> \n\nOverall, air pollution in Berlin increases from the periphery to the center. For PM2.5, the values in the least polluted PLR were 14.8 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 and in the most polluted PLR 18.4 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the benchmark value of 10 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was exceeded in all PLRs in Berlin. For NO2, the values ranged from 11.3 to 27.3 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the WHO guideline value of 40 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was not exceeded.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-02-21","national_data_updated_date":"2021-07-16","target_number":"3.3","goal_number":"3"},"10-2-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-10.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","graph_title":"Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"10.2.1","indicator_definition":"This indicator is a measure of relative income poverty at the national level.
